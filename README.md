# Flash-Emulation-Library

This is a library to store user data in the flash memory of STM32 devices. The flash memory in STM32 devices can be used as an EEPROM to store the user data. This provides several APIS to write data into the flash memory and read data from the flash memory. 
The library is dependent on the STM32 HAL libraries.
